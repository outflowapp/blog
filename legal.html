      <h1><a id="Terms_of_Service__Privacy_Policy_0"></a>Terms of Service + Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>TLDR</strong>: We do not store any of your data unless directly permitted and we are not responsible for unsuccessfully notifying users of subscription payments.</p>
      <h2><a id="General_2"></a>General</h2>
      <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Outflow (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by kirkbyo (Ozzie Kirkby). The Application allows it’s users to keep track of repeating subscriptions. The app requires the user to enter data regarding the subscription. However, Outflow, and it’s creators cannot be held responsible for unsuccessfully notifying users of subscription payments. Also, Outflow, and it’s creators are not responsible for any incorrect user data entered in the app. Data directly pertaining to a subscription such as renewal frequency, price, payment method, company information, notes or any other piece of data entered by the user will only be stored on the user’s device and never be shared unless otherwise permitted (example below). Outflow doesn’t require any personal user details to be entered anywhere in the app and therefor is not connected to a user’s subscriptions.</p>
      <h3><a id="Automatic_subscription_finding_5"></a>Automatic subscription finding</h3>
      <p>Outflow provides mechanisms for entering your Gmail account credential and will attempt to find subscriptions on your behalf. Outflow does not store any the credentials entered by the user, and the entire authenticating process is handled by the <a href="https://github.com/google/GTMAppAuth">Google GTMAppAuth</a> library. All subscriptions found are based on a probability and should be considered suggestions, just because Outflow recommends a service it does not mean you are paying for it, it just means we have detected it. Use your own personal judgment when assessing your suggestions. Outflow, and it’s creators are not responsible for any subscription NOT found or any incorrect data suggested by the app. The subscription finding process happens entirely on your phone and relies on no outside servers. That being said, all your emails that are analyzed are not stored anywhere after the app is cleared from memory. We are not trying to do anything malicious with this feature; we are just trying to provide a convenient way to add new subscriptions.</p>
