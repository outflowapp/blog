Added several convenient features that hopefully make Outflow even more enjoyable to use!

- Subscriptions will now automatically be backed up to iCloud (this can be disabled in the settings).

- Added several new currencies: IDR, HKD, NOK, AED and TWD.

- Subscriptions can now be archived during off periods.

- Fixed currency symbol issue.

- Minor other bug fixes.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on Twitter (@outflowapp) or to shoot us an email (hello@outflowapp.com).
